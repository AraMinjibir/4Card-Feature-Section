# 4Card-Feature-Section

This project was designed with four cards features containing advert of a coding Company.
The goal of doing this is to enhance my proficiency in coding for both HTML and CSS. 
The design was of two types. 
1. The first one is Desktop size view, this is for those who are using Desktops and Laptops. It consist four cards inside one container, the container was devided into two that is header and mother. Header consist the welcome note (About us note), while the Mother has three containers(i.e son, bro, daughter), it has a flexbox which directed them to be rows and justifyied the contents to be centered. bro container has two containers inside it (phase1 and phase2), meaning they are not siblings to son and daughter but rather  children of bro. It has flexbox container with column direction and alighned the items to be centered.
2. The second one is Mobile size view, this is for those who are using mobile phones. It has four cards inside one container  as well, the container was divided into fives distinct sub-containers, that is header, son, phase1, phase2, and daughter (they are all siblings). It has a flexbox container that directed them to column and aligned the items to be centered.
